# My-Twitter-bots
**Welcome to my Twitter bots preview page!**
- This repo is for archiving *most* of my Twitter bots I have made.
- Unfortunately, after Elon takeover, the API's prices gone up by ALOT, ALOT ALOT.
- Thats why most of these bots and websites are not working :(.  
- The free plan has write-only access, and the cheapest plan now costs 100$/month! And at the same time doesn't give as much access as the old free one!
- Literally the same old free API limits now costs $5k/month!!!!!!
- BRUH

# Game bots

- I have built more than one Twitter Game bot, inspired by a youtuber who have made Snake bot in Twitter!


## **Connect 4**
- The first one is Connect4 bot!
  This is the first game bot I have made, and it was amazing!
  It prints the board image, then waits for some time (the delay was like 10 minutes if I remember correctly), then it fetches the replies and take the most liked move, and play it using *Player*     side.
  Then, it uses MiniMax algorithm to make the AI move.
  Then it prints board image again!
