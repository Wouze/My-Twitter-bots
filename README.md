# My-Twitter-bots
**Welcome to my Twitter bots preview page!**
- This repo is for archiving *most* of my Twitter bots I have made.
- Unfortunately, after Elon takeover, the API's prices gone up by ALOT, ALOT ALOT.
- Thats why most of these bots and websites are not working :(.  
- The free plan has write-only access, and the cheapest plan now costs 100$/month! And at the same time doesn't give as much access as the old free one!
- Literally the same old free API limits now costs $5k/month!!!!!!
- BRUH

## **Connect 4**
- The first one is Connect4 bot!
  This is the first game bot I have made, and it was amazing!
  It prints the board image, then waits for some time (the delay was like 10 minutes if I remember correctly), then it fetches the replies and take the most liked move, and play it using *Player*     side.
  Then, it uses MiniMax algorithm to make the AI move.
  Then it prints board image again!

## Others
#### I have made so much bots, that I have around 3~4 twitter developer accounts!
- Twitter bot that retweet every tweet with specefic words
- Freelanced Twitter bot that uses chatgpt to reply
- Scrapnig bots
- Logs bots
- around 4~5 noise maker bots, that uses Twitter stream to filter out special words to reply with appropriate reply (like filter *basket ball related words* and reply with *basket ball teams/tournaments/etc..*, and at the same time, if someone figured out it was a bot, and told the bot "You are bot", the bot will reply that he is not a bot! those bots were the most funniest bots I have made ever

# I Hope you enjoyed it!
